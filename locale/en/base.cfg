[mod-setting-description]
tree-cleaner-chunk-range=(default=3) Radius in 32-tile chunks the mod will check around each player for dead trees. Setting to zero (0) will effectively turn off the feature, since it will search player+-0 tiles.
tree-cleaner-cliffs-too=(default=true) Whether to flag cliffs within the radius for deconstruction, as well.
